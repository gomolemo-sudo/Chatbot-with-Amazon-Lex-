# Chatbot-with-Amazon-Lex- 

### **Overview**

- 📌 **Fallback Handling**: Configured **FallbackIntent** for unrecognized inputs  
- 📌 **Intent Variations**: Improved accuracy by adding multiple input variations  
- 📌 **AWS IAM Integration**: Assigned minimal permissions for secure API access  

### **Lessons Learned**
